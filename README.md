ES6 - The new face of JS!
---------------------
It is pretty apparent that ES6 is rapidly taking over, it is important that we prepare ourselves for this change.
To do so we need to be acquainted with the various new features ES6 supports.

Set-up an ES6 project - GETTING STARTED
---------------------
This repo sets up a project that integrates Babel and Browserify to write code in ES6 that can be understood and executed by various browsers. 

What is Babel?
---------------------
In plain words, Babel is a transpiler for JavaScript best known for its ability to turn ES6 (the next version of JavaScript) into code that runs in your browser (or on your server) today. 
For more info, check this out: https://babeljs.io/

What is Browserify?
---------------------
Browserify allows us to use node.js style modules in the browser. We define dependencies and then Browserify bundles it all up into a single neat and tidy JavaScript file.
